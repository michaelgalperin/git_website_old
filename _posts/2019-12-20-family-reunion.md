title: A Family Reunion for the Chicago Music Community
---

If you're a musician in the city, you get to know a lot of other musicians. Everyone runs into each other at jams, comes to each other's shows, shares each other's new releases when they come out. The community is enormous, and it's held together by love and support - everyone is just *so excited* to see each other succeed.

At the same time, while it's easy to meet people, it can be harder to play music with them. The nitty-gritty of putting together a band - booking shows, promoting them, recording music - all takes a huge amount of work and commitment. My friends and I always felt that there were so many talented musicians who we knew and admired, but with whom we didn't ever have the chance to collaborate because everyone had so little time.

**Family Reunion** aims to solve this problem. Here's how it works:
- We pick a Saturday night to have a giant show, and get a venue on board to host it.
- From a running list of interested musicians (one that grows with every event), we put together two bands based on musicians' responses to an online survey. Some of the musicians in a band may know each other already, some may not.
- After we make the bands, we send everybody the instrumentation for their group. We ask every musician to write a new original song and arrange it specifically for their band.
- The Friday before the show, we meet for a family dinner. Then we rehearse on Friday night, come back to rehearse all of Saturday, and play the show on Saturday night.

Learning 10 new songs, all by different composers, with less than a day of rehearsal, and then immediately playing them live, is a completely crazy, all-consuming, terrifying undertaking. There's no escape route, since people will come to see the show no matter how good or bad you sound. This is also what makes the shows exciting and so great for musicians - because the arrangements are fresh and the songs haven't been played before, the rehearsals flow with ideas and transform the songs. And by introducing musicians who haven't played together before, each event spawns further collaborations that go beyond a single show.


### Family Reunion, March 2018
Family Reunion has grown from a house party in my basement to a full-fledged event, hosted at a venue (with posters!). The latest one was in March 2018 at the Co-Prosperity Sphere, an art gallery and community space in the Bridgeport neighborhood of Chicago. 

The musicians were:

Becca Baruc made an incredible poster for the event, for which she literally ***drew*** all of us by hand. And Nathan Mansakahn took some amazing photos. Here are some of them:
